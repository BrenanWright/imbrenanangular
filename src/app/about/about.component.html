        <h2 class="card-title">brief summary of me</h2>
        <p class="card-text">I am a student at the University of Alabama who is graduating in May of 2019 with a B.S.
          in Management Information Systems and a minor in Economics.
          I am an intuitive problem solver who loves to create. This love of creating extends from myself into
          writing, photography, film, and programming.
          I see programming as the ultimate middle-ground between the right brain and the left brain.
          To logically work out problems gets the problem-solving left-brain neurons firing, and outputting something
          that is visible and tangible gets my creative right-brain neurons firing; I absolutely love coding and I thrive
          in it.
          I have learned many different coding languages over my time in school including C#, Java, C, Python,
          Javascript, and a myriad of different ways to manipulate those and create software projects such as Angular,
          .NET Core, Django and more.
          I have worn many hats on different projects during my time at Alabama including project manager, tech lead,
          designer, and developer.
          Alabama's MIS program has placed a focus on communication and business acumen as well.
          Since my first semester in the program we have been practiced in meeting with clients, gathering
          requirements, explaining solutions, and delivering upon their needs and requirements.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Other than what is essentially my cover letter, I have deep love of the arts. I think
          there is no limit to
          what art can express and I take a lot of pride in creating, whether it be photography, web-design, writing,
          theatre, or film.
          I am an absolute film-enthusiast, and I could beat almost anyone at film trivia! I hope some day to leverage
          these creative interests into being involved in the filmmaking process as a career, either in screenwriting
          or directing.</p>
