      <h5>Explanation of what was going on for anyone curious</h5>
      <p> There used to be a POST request for your username and password going on when you hit log-in on this modal-form.
        The back-end checked these values using the UserManager in .NetCore and returned a request based on if your credentials were verified.
        If they were good credentials and they were in the database it generated a JWT security token which was stored in the local storage of your browser.
      </p>
